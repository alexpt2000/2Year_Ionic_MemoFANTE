Hybrid mobile technologies empower a web developer to develop mobile applications which run on multiple mobile platforms. All without learning native platform languages and utilizing existing skills.

Hybrid Mobile technologies have evolved a lot and many different platforms exist.

A new Hybrid Mobile development platform to consider is Ionic.

Ionic is an advanced HTML5 Hybrid Mobile App Framework. Itâ€™s an open-source front-end framework for creating beautiful mobile applications using HTML5.

Ionic apps are based on Cordova, so Cordova utilities can be used to build, deploy and test apps. Ionic focuses on the look and feel of apps and it currently uses AngularJS to build awesome looking front-ends.


Installation
To get started with Ionic, first make sure you have Node.js installed.

Next, depending on the app platform for which you plan to develop, install the required Android or IOS platform dependencies. 

Next, install the latest Cordova and Ionic command line tool as shown below:

npm install -g cordova ionic
